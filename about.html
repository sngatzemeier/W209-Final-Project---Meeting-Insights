									<h3>Project Concept</h3>
								</header>
                            	<p>
									Collaboration has a significant value by which it enables organizations to achieve their goals. In any organization, all jobs are dependent on cross-functional teams of individuals coming together to address the challenge they face collectively. Besides, collaboration spurs innovation. Such collaboration happens in various settings (examples include one-to-one discussion, brainstorming sessions, team discussions, ad-hoc meetings, structured updates) pursued by different organizations and individuals. All these forums are focused on bringing people together to share their ideas and solve problems. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic effect, even an informal talk is a zoom meeting. There is an increasing number of meetings that occupy our calendars. While these meetings are essential, an overwhelming number of them can be energy-draining and prevent individuals from analyzing time. Again, not all meetings have to be efficient and effective. Conferences are a means to an end, helping individuals achieve assigned goals. One has to wonder if the sessions are efficient and enable us to achieve our goals. Besides, managers and individuals prioritize how they spend their time on topics to get their valuable time slots. This project aims to provide visualizations that help individuals and managers achieve the goal of understanding how their and their team's time is spent during a workday and how it can be streamlined to better their chances of success.

							<h3>Model Dataset Used for this Analysis</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							This dataset contains information from 288,042 special meetings from a mock organization. The data is generalized meeting data from Microsoft (Source: Fereshteh). We will leverage several exciting features for insights and visualizations. This diagram provides users with a clear understanding of the model dataset we are using in this analysis. The description of the dataset and tasks we are trying to resolve and want users to solve is listed here. This product is flexible to be able to replace this model data with new meeting dataset when made available. This page can be used as a user guide.

							<h3>Meeting Effectiveness Data Structure</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							Image above provides the data structure that has been used to study the effectiveness of meetings. We aggregate meetings data by meeting organizers level in the organization and the function type they belong to in the organization. This aggregation is then used across several key metrics data thatis provided in the dataset. This includes meeting day, number of meetings, meeting duration, conflicts / multi tasking / and emails sent during the meetings, and the invitee behavior to meeting notice. The data has several limitations and we do not have details behind invitees themselves. In addition, details behind multi tasking activity is not provided. So, we have to make some assumptions. The task for the users is to understand if the meetings across the organization is efficient and effective using some of the key factors.
