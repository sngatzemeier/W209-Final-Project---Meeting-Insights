									<h3>Project Concept</h3>
								</header>
                            	<p>
									Collaboration has a significant value by which it enables organizations to achieve their goals. In any organization, all jobs are dependent on cross-functional teams of individuals coming together to address the challenge they face collectively. Besides, collaboration spurs innovation. Such collaboration happens in various settings (examples include one-to-one discussion, brainstorming sessions, team discussions, ad-hoc meetings, structured updates) pursued by different organizations and individuals. All these forums are focused on bringing people together to share their ideas and solve problems. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic effect, even an informal talk is a zoom meeting. There is an increasing number of meetings that occupy our calendars. While these meetings are essential, an overwhelming number of them can be energy-draining and prevent individuals from analyzing time. Again, not all meetings have to be efficient and effective. Conferences are a means to an end, helping individuals achieve assigned goals. One has to wonder if the sessions are efficient and enable us to achieve our goals. Besides, managers and individuals prioritize how they spend their time on topics to get their valuable time slots. This project aims to provide visualizations that help individuals and managers achieve the goal of understanding how their and their team's time is spent during a workday and how it can be streamlined to better their chances of success.
